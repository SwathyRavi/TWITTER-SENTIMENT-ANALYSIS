# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
            
This project is based on Twitter Sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms in python. In this project we used Tweepy API for authentication and streaming tweets form the twitter. Collected tweets are Pre-processed with the help of Natural Language Processing and regular expressions. With the help of Machine learning algorithms, we have created a model for sentiment analysis in which we make use concept of pickling in python. With the help of this model we can predict the sentiment of the tweets. In this project we have developed an application with the help of PySide2, purpose of the application is to clean and analyse the sentiment of the tweets taken from user. We will be comparing different tools like Spark and Python for the better accuracy of analysis. Visualization is the better way to memorize and to understand everything easily. Visualization helps a layman to understand everything at a glance. In this project we used some popular online and offline visualization tools for the visualization of our results. Those tools are IBM Watson/Congo analytics, Tableau, python, R studio. To make the project more interactive and user friendly we developed a GUI using python which has the ability to extract the data and to visualize the extracted data manually.
